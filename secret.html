  <p><b>My baby,</b></p>
  <p>
  I want you to know that you are enough exactly the way you are. You don’t have to be anything to deserve love. You already do. Just by being you.
  </p>

  <p>
  There are so many things about you that are quietly beautiful the way you care, the way you listen, the way you try even when you’re tired, the way you keep going even when things feel heavy. You might not always see it, but I see it. And it all matters.
  </p>

  <p>
  On the days when you doubt yourself, when your mind tells you you’re not doing enough or being enough, I hope you come back to this and remember that you are valued, you are appreciated, and you are deeply loved. Your presence itself makes a difference. Your heart is gentle and kind, and that is something rare.
  </p>

  <p>
  You don’t have to have everything figured out. You don’t have to be perfect. You’re allowed to feel tired, to feel confused, to take your time. You are still worthy on your worst days, not just your best ones.
  </p>

  <p>
  No matter where you are or what you’re feeling, I want you to know that someone is always rooting for you, believing in you, and holding you in their thoughts with a lot of love and care.
  </p>

  <p>
  You are safe to be yourself.  
  You are not alone.  
  And you are loved more than you probably realize.
  </p>

  <p><b>Always 💗</b></p>
